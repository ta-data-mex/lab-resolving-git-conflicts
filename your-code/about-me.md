# Who am I

* My name is Alejandro Arroyo.I am originally from León, México but have lived in the US and the UK.
* I am a brand strategist. I used to work for an agency in London.
* I have very superficial knowledge about data. I love technology but have never been exposed to coding.

# Why am I here

* I expect to develop my computer programming skills, as well as strengthen my quantitative analysis abilities. I think they will be a useful complement to my existing professional experience.
* I hope I'm able to master the use of data, databases and everything that contains valuable information. I would love to become an expert in deriving insight from such sources.

# What will I do after the bootcamp?

* I would love to work in the tech sector, ideally in merging marketing with data analytics.
* I would be in charge of brand/marketing analytics for a start-up or tech firm.
* I'd love to become the Chief Brand Officer for Airbnb.

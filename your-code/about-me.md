Qué aburrido :P mejor una canción:

Just shoot for the stars if it feels right
And aim for my heart if you feel like it
Take me away and make it okay
I swear I'll behave
You wanted control so we waited
I put on a show now we're naked
You say I'm a kid my ego is big
I don't give a shit and it goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you all the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you with them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
Baby it's hard when you feel like
You're broken and scarred
Nothing feels right, but when you're with me
I make you believe that I've got the key
Oh, so get in the car we can ride it
Wherever you want get inside it
And you want to steer, but I'm shifting gear
I'll take it from here oh yeah yeah and it goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you all the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you with them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
You want to know how to make me smile
Take control, own me just for the night
But if I share my secret you're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
So watch and learn I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh baby, rub me right
But if I share my secret you're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you all the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you with them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
